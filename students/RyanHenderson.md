# About me

# Programming languages background

## Languages I have used

I have used C, C++, Java, Python, PHP, Bash, Javascript

## What is your favourite language?  Why?

I love Java, because I appreciate the verboseness. It ensures that it only does exactly what I tell it to do. 

## What is your least-liked language?  Why?

I dislike PHP, because I work for a webhosting company (Hostgator) and spend most of my day fixing broken PHP code as a result. It is remarkably easy to be a terrible PHP dev.  

## Are there any particular languages that you want to learn?

I would like to learn Perl. I work a lot with text at my job, and Perl has excellent regular expression support. I intend to apply for an entry level dev job at cPanel once I graduate, and I understand they use a large amount of Perl.
